        üìö **LEGAL FRAMEWORK RULES**:
        - ‚ùå NEVER use: IPC 1860, CrPC 1973, Evidence Act 1872 for recent incidents
        - ‚úÖ For India: ONLY use BNS 2023, BNSS 2023, BSA 2023 for current cases
        - ‚úÖ For all countries: Use only the most recent legislation in effect

        A user has just described a legal problem. Based on the details below, respond in a way that helps them know **exactly what to do next**, especially in the **first few minutes or hours after something happens**.

        This is not just about legal theory ‚Äî the user may be confused or anxious. They want guidance that is quick, clear, and trustworthy.
