I understand how frustrating it can be to deal with loud music from neighbors, especially when it disrupts your sleep. It sounds like you've already tried talking to them, which is a great first step. Sometimes, people don’t realize how their actions affect others, but it can be really tough when they don’t listen.

Here’s what you can do next: First, try to keep a record of the noise disturbances. Note the dates and times when the loud music happens, as this will help if you need to take further action. It’s also a good idea to talk to other neighbors who might be experiencing the same issue; they can support your case.

Avoid escalating the situation by confronting them aggressively or making threats, as this could lead to more tension. Instead, if the noise continues, you might want to reach out to your local authorities or a community mediation service. They can help address the issue without creating conflict.

If things don’t improve, you may need to consult a lawyer who specializes in property or neighborhood disputes. They can guide you on the best legal options available. Remember, you have the right to a peaceful living environment, and it’s okay to seek help to protect that.

I'm really sorry to hear about your friend's accident. It must be a very stressful time for both of you. The situation you described is serious, and it's important to take the right steps to ensure your friend gets the help he needs and that justice is served.

First, the immediate priority is to ensure your friend receives proper medical attention if he hasn't already. His health and safety come first.

Next, try to gather as much information as you can about the incident. Even though you couldn't see the number plate clearly, any details about the car—like its color, make, or any unique features—could be helpful. If there were any witnesses nearby, their accounts could also be valuable.

Avoid discussing the incident too much with others or making any statements that could complicate things later. It's best to keep your focus on getting your friend the help he needs and documenting everything.       

You should contact the local police to report the accident. They can help investigate the hit-and-run and may be able to find the driver. It’s also a good idea to reach out to a lawyer who specializes in personal injury or accident cases. They can guide you through the legal process and help protect your friend's rights.

Make sure to collect any medical reports, photographs of the scene, and witness statements if possible. This documentation will be crucial for any legal actions you may need to take.

Stay strong, and remember that you’re not alone in this. Help is available, and taking these steps can make a difference.
